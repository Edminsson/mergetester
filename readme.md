## A repo for some testing the danger of rebasing.

- Created feature branch for feat1 and created a pull request which was approved.
- Created feature branch for feat2 which was rebased with main (not sure if it the right way to call it. From branch feat 1 I run "git rebase main").
- Created feature branch for feat3 which was merged with main instead of rebased.
